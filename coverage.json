Do not rely on prior partial removals; re-audit the full hard-coded event list for every artist and confirm no event with venue 'Kulturzentrum', city 'Rostock', country 'Germany', or dateTime '2026-03-05T...' survives in any artist's event set. After removal, Richie Hawtin must have exactly one seeded event ('Detroit Love Day 1: Richie Hawtin - Carl Craig - Dennis Ferrer', TBA venue, Detroit, USA, '2026-02-27T22:00:00Z'). All other artist event datasets must remain unchanged. The `postupgrade` system hook must continue to call `initializeSeedData` unconditionally so the corrected data is present on every deploy.",
