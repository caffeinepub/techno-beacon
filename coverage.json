Expose two new update functions: `addEventToRadar(eventId: Text) : async Result` and `removeEventFromRadar(eventId: Text) : async Result`, both requiring an authenticated caller. Expose one new query function: `getRadarEvents() : async [Event]` that returns the full event records for all event IDs saved by the calling principal.",

If the event is already saved, show the button in an active/filled state labelled '📡 On Radar' and clicking it calls `removeEventFromRadar` with a toast ('Removed from Radar'). If the user is unauthenticated, clicking the button shows a toast prompting login ('Log in to save events to your Radar'). Style the button consistently with the dark techno theme (neon amber accent, compact size, same visual weight as the existing '✈ Plan Trip' button).",
