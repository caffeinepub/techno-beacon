  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-1 and REQ-2 through frontend changes: AdminInitButton.tsx is updated with correct admin detection logic and spinner timeout behavior, ArtistsPage.tsx renders AdminInitButton for authenticated users, and useQueries.ts includes useIsAdmin with proper enabled conditions. REQ-3 (backend verification) shows no evidence of backend/main.mo changes.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Verify the backend initializeSeedData function is callable and returns successfully when invoked by an admin principal. Ensure the admin access control check in the backend correctly identifies the admin caller.",
      "reason": "No changes to backend/main.mo are present in the diff. The backend actor file is not modified, so there is no evidence that admin access control or seed data initialization logic was verified or fixed.",
