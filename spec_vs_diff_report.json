  "summary": "The diff modifies backend/main.mo and project_state.json. The backend file shows the Dave Clarke seed data structure is present, but the file is truncated so the exact 9 event records cannot be fully verified. The frontend file frontend/src/lib/eventIdLookup.ts is NOT present in the diff at all, meaning REQ-109 appears unimplemented.",

      "id": "REQ-109",
      "requirement": "In `frontend/src/lib/eventIdLookup.ts`, update all entries for Dave Clarke's events to match the corrected venue strings and dateTimes from REQ-108, including Vancouver, Toronto, Nancy, Paris, Brighton, Cardiff, Ostend, and Iceland entries, and remove any stale composite keys.",
      "reason": "The file `frontend/src/lib/eventIdLookup.ts` does not appear anywhere in the diff. It was neither added nor modified, so none of the required lookup table updates for Dave Clarke's 9 events were made.",
