  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements (REQ-57 through REQ-61) with good coverage. Backend adds the stable radar map and three new functions; frontend adds the three new hooks, the Add to Radar button in EventCard and ArtistEventPopup, and a Saved Events section in MyRadarPage. A few specific acceptance criteria have gaps worth noting.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-61",
      "requirement": "Each saved event row must show the same ticket-search buttons (Dice / Songkick) already present on other event cards.",
      "reason": "The SavedEventRow component in MyRadarPage.tsx renders only a single generic 'Tickets' link using event.eventUrl, not the dual Dice / Songkick ticket-search buttons present on EventCard. The spec explicitly requires the same ticket-search buttons already present on other event cards.",

      "requirement": "The stable HashMap must survive canister upgrades via a stable variable declaration.",
      "reason": "The visible declaration shows `var userRadarEvents = Map.empty<Principal, Set.Set<Text>>()` without the `stable` keyword. Without stable, radar data would be lost on upgrade. The diff is truncated so this cannot be confirmed resolved elsewhere.",
