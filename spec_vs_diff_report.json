  "summary": "The diff shows changes to backend/main.mo, several frontend pages, and utility files. The backend appears to implement _forceSeedData with the Rostock event removed, and frontend pages add defensive filters. However, the critical frontend file `frontend/src/lib/eventIdLookup.ts` is not present in the diff at all, meaning REQ-105 cannot be confirmed as implemented.",

      "requirement": "In `frontend/src/lib/eventIdLookup.ts`, perform a thorough audit and remove every entry whose composite key could correspond to the Kulturzentrum Rostock event (Thu 5 Mar 2026, Rostock, Germany) regardless of which artist it is keyed under — including Richie Hawtin, Juan Atkins, and Joey Beltram.",
      "reason": "The file `frontend/src/lib/eventIdLookup.ts` does not appear anywhere in the diff (neither as a modified nor added file). There is no evidence that Rostock/Kulturzentrum entries were removed from the event ID lookup table.",

It explicitly states non-goal: modifying frontend pages beyond the eventIdLookup.ts cleanup. Adding runtime filters in DiscoverPage.tsx and ArtistDetailPage.tsx was not requested.",
