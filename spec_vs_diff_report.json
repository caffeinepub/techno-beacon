  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-67, REQ-68, REQ-69) appear to be implemented. The diff shows: a new `buildTicketSearchUrl` utility added, `EventCard.tsx` updated with Dice/Songkick buttons and import of `buildTicketSearchUrl`, `ArtistEventPopup.tsx` updated with the same, and `MyRadarPage.tsx` updated with both ticket buttons. File summaries confirm no ra.co links remain. The diff is truncated but evidence is consistent across all three files.",
