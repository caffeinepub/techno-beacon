The backend file is truncated so full content of Dave Clarke's 9 events cannot be fully verified, but the structure appears present. The frontend file frontend/src/lib/eventIdLookup.ts is not included in the diff at all, meaning REQ-107 cannot be confirmed as implemented.",

      "requirement": "In frontend/src/lib/eventIdLookup.ts, update entries for Dave Clarke's 9 events to match corrected venue strings and dateTimes (Vancouver, Toronto, Brighton, Cardiff), remove stale composite keys, so Add to Radar functionality works correctly.",
      "reason": "The file frontend/src/lib/eventIdLookup.ts is not present in the diff at all — neither added nor modified. There is no evidence this file was updated.",

      "reason": "The build request requires postupgrade to call initializeSeedData unconditionally, but the diff shows postupgrade calling _forceSeedData() instead. This structural refactoring was not requested and deviates from the specified constraint.",
